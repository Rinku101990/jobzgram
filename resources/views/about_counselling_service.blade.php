                     <p>Kids need counselling at every stage of their lives. Unfortunately, most people wait till adulthood to identify their problems and then spend a lot of money on overcoming them. Prevention of such problems is what Kids Fable provides through its extensive counselling services for kids and parents alike. We believe in the importance of instilling life skills & strong beliefs in kids from their formative years so that they grow up into more insightful individuals with a healthy attitude towards life.</p>

                     <p>It’s a fast-paced world for kids and there’s a lot to take in for them, especially since they are not in school, thanks to COVID-19. Not that their lives were any easier before. But now, with reduced exposure to the outside world and lack of social contact, kids are becoming more isolated than ever before. Away from school, their screen time has increased, thanks to online classes as well as recreational activities like mobile games. It’s difficult for parents to keep a track since they get busy with work from home & other chores. Managing screen time & spending time with kids to understand their emotional & psychological well-being is crucial in the beginner stage.</p>

                     <h3 class="mb-2">Just Academics?</h3>
                     <p>While academics take up a lot of our children’s time leaving little scope for anything else, it's upon the parents to provide kids with life hacks that help them navigate the tough world while keeping their emotional intelligence intact. Still a lot to do, huh?</p>
                     <p class="mt-2">Anger management, depression, anxiety and nervousness are some of the key problems affecting kids these days. As they battle varied pressures of school, tuitions, peer influence & more in the 21st century, important life skills go missing in them.</p>

                     <h3 class="mb-2">What’s worse? </h3>
                     <p>It doesn’t hit them until they are adults that they haven’t had any training on how to cope up with the challenges of life. The result? They have to begin a life-long process of healing from their childhood patterns and find alternative ways to deal with challenges in their way of life.</p>
                     <p class="mt-2">
                        Prevention is better than cure. While most adults spend a lot of money on trauma healing, it is much better to instill these life skills in them when they are kids. Seemingly small behaviour issues like anger, trauma, bullying, parental fights, sibling rivalry, shyness, under-confidence can turn into bigger, more serious issues as the kids grow up. It’s important to identify these problems while they are in their early stages and work on it from the very beginning.

                     <p>Wellness in kids is way more important than finding a cure for their remedies later on in life. And that is why, Kids Fable has designed its counselling services that can focus on overall wellness and prevention of mental health challenges.</p>
